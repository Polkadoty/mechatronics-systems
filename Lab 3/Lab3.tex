\section{Introduction}
In this experiment we take a look at (1) Using a linear potentiometer to measure displacement of a small scale wing model with weights attached at different locations, (2) Determining the twist angle from these displacement measurements, and (3) Calculating the shear center, bending stiffness, and torsional stiffness of the wing model. 

This experiment attempts to accurately model measurements from the linear potentiometer in comparison to the ideal linear relationship from theoretical predictions. From these measurements we can then calculate the wing's shear center location and stiffness.  

\section{Equipment}
Devices used in this lab include:
\begin{itemize}

\item Digital Calipers: Used for measuring outer and inner dimensions of objects. In our case, digital calipers were used to measure the chord length of the small scale wing platofrm, the distance steps taken to calibrate the linear potentiometer, and the markings indicating chordwise locations for weight placement on the wing model.
\vspace{2.5mm}

\item Brass Slotted Weights with hanger: Used to induce bending on the wing model to acquire displacement measurements. Total $250$ grams.
\vspace{2.5mm}

\item LP804 Series Miniature Linear Potentiometer: Device used to measure linear position and displacement from wing bending and twisting.
\vspace{2.5mm}

\item 'Rare Earth' Magnets: High strength magnets used for secure placement of linear potentiometer to the wing platform to acquire measurements without slippage.
\vspace{2.5mm}

\item DAQ, NI-9215 Voltage Input Module, and LabVIEW: Data Acquisition System used to process data collected by digitizing the analog information into "bins" for a computer. NI-9215 used to measure the input voltage signals for the DAQ system. LabVIEW used to model voltages through the DAQ read from the linear potentiometer displacement.
\vspace{2.5mm}

\item Solderless Breadboard and Jumper Wires: Used to make connections from the linear potentiometer to power, ground, and signals for data collection.

\end{itemize}

\section{Procedure}
This section covers our procedure for this experiment broken into three parts. NOTE: For gathering measurements, ensure the standard deviation has reached a very small approximate steady-state and then mark down the LabVIEW output (upto the thousandth decimal digit).

\subsection{Calibration of Linear Potentiometer}
This first part contains our procedure for calibrating the linear potentiometer. Before beginning calibration, this part required connection setup of the linear potentiometer to the DAQ, NI-9215, and LabVIEW to collect and process data to model the input voltage measurements.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Ensure connection between the DAQ system (NI-9215) and the Linear Potentiometer is correct.
\vspace{2.5mm}

\item Take the potentiometer and place it on its side for better control of its displacement.
\vspace{2.5mm}

\item Using the digital calipers, measure from the base of the moving shaft on the linear potentiometer to the first displacement step $x_{1}$. We let the displacement step $\Delta x \approx 10\, mm$ for our calibration process. 
\vspace{2.5mm}

\item From the LabVIEW plot, gather the average voltage with the standard deviation for $x_{1}$. This will be a repeated process for each $x_{i}$.
\vspace{2.5mm}

\item Repeat the displacement and measurement process for $i>=5$ times, i.e. the next step is $x_{2} \approx 20\, mm$. We let $i = 6$ with an additional final calibration measurement $\approx 20\, mm$ from the $x_{6}$ step to cover the full range of the $5V$ input voltage.
\vspace{2.5mm}

\item We are now able to take the calibration data into Data Processing for plotting displacement $mm$ versus voltage $V$ to observe the linearity of the linear potentiomenter.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Chordwise Displacement}
This is Part 1 of measuring displacements from weights attached to our wing model. Enusre proper setup of the linear potentiometer under the wing platform to begin displacement measurement at different chordwise locations.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item With the digital caliper, measure the chord length of the wing model. With the caliper, make $n>=10$ markings for chordwise locations between $0$ and $c$ (chord). For our setup, we marked chordwise locations $y_{c} \approx \left[0,\, 10,\, 20,\, 30,\, 40,\, 50,\, 60,\, 70,\, 80,\, 90,\, 100\right]\, mm$, from trailing edge to leading edge.
  \vspace{2.5mm}
  
  \item Place a 'rare earth' magnet to either the leading edge or trailing edge joint and secure the tip of the potentiometer to that joint.
  \vspace{2.5mm}

  \item Hang the weight ($250$ grams in our setup) to the first chordwise position and gather the average voltage with the standard deviation from the LabVIEW model. This will be used to process displacement measurement.
  \vspace{2.5mm}

  \item Repeat step (3) through each $y_{c}$ element and mark down the measurements for each position.
  \vspace{2.5mm}

  \item Once finished with measurements at the first edge, switch to the other edge and follow steps (3) and (4) again. For example, if leading edge was chosen first, position the magnet and potentiomenter to the trailing edge joint next.
  \vspace{2.5mm}

  \item After finishing these procedure, take measurements into Data Processing for determining the Shear Center location of the wing model.
\end{enumerate}

  \subsection{Spanwise Displacement}
  Part 2 of displacement measurements involve measuring spanwise displacement due to weight hanging at three different trailing edge joints throughout the span of the wing platform. Ensure proper setup of linear potentiomenter under the span of the wing platform. 
  \begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{lab3images/SpanwiseLocations.jpg}
    \caption{Spanwise position indexing with Leading and Trailing Edge labels}
  \end{figure}
  
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Start by hanging the weight at the $6^{th}$ position as shown in \textbf{Figure (1)}. 
    \vspace{2.5mm}

    \item Place the magnet and potentiomenter at a spanwise location of choice and gather the input voltage measurement along with the standard deviation.
    \vspace{2.5mm}

    \item Repeat (2) measurements for all other spanwise locations.
    \vspace{2.5mm}

    \item Next, move the weight to the $5^{th}$ position.
    \vspace{2.5mm}

    \item Follow steps (2) and (3) for spanwise positions $x_{S} = \left[1,\, 2,\, 4,\, 5\right]$
    \vspace{2.5mm}

    \item Lastly, move the weight to position $4$
    \vspace{2.5mm}

    \item Follow steps (2) and (3) for positions $x_{S} = \left[1,\, 4\right]$
    \vspace{2.5mm}
    
    \item Now the spanwise data can be taken to Data Processing for computing torque and stiffness on the wing model

The calibration table in Table (\ref{table:calibration_data}) represents how we gained the voltage to displacement relationship for the linear potentiometer.  The voltage data was then plotted against the displacement data and a linear relationship was found, as shown in figure (\ref{fig:Calibration}). 

(\ref{tab:LE_TE_Data}) contains the voltage data at various positions along the chord.  It is then converted into distance using the calibration equation.  The deflection at the Leading Edge and Trailing Edge is used to calculate the angle of twist with (\ref{eq:theta}) %arctan eq
and shear center of the wing.  Plotting the angle of twist against the X position gives a linear representation where the intersect at 0 radians will be the shear center.  This is shown in figure (\ref{fig:YvsTwist}) %add graph here
and the shear center is determined to be at 31\% of the chord length, or at 31.25 (mm).

For this section, \(X_j\) was taken as 27.5 in, or 69.85 \(cm\), the following values were calculated using equations (1), (2), (3), and (4).  
The measured deflection at the 3 \(X_i\) values were plotted against the theoretical deflection and the slope of the graph was set equal to \(\frac{S_j}{EI}\).  Solving for EI yielded a bending stiffness value of 490.5 \(N*m^2\).

As for our uncertainty, we can use the least count of our different measuring devices as a basis for the overall uncertainty. That gives us the following equation:
\[
\delta_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{\delta_{\text{caliper}}^2 + \delta_{\text{STD}}^2 + \delta_{\text{potentiometer}}^2 + \delta_{\text{DAQ}}^2}
\]

In this case, the caliper or ruler measurements are accurate to the nearest millimeter, the potentiomenter is accurate to the nearest hundredth of a millimeter, and the DAQ is accurate to the nearest thousandth of a volt. This gives us the following uncertainties: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Caliper: \(\delta_{\text{caliper}} = 0.5\, \text{mm}\)
  \item Standard Deviation: \(\delta_{\text{std}} = 0.001\, \text{mm}\)
  \item Potentiometer: \(\delta_{\text{potentiometer}} = 0.013\, \text{mm}\)
  \item DAQ: \(\delta_{\text{DAQ}} = 0.001\, \text{V}\)
\end{itemize}

For our overall propagation of uncertainty, we have:
\[
\delta_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{0.5^2 + + 0.001^2 + 0.013^2 + 0.001^2} = 0.501\, \text{mm}
\]

\section{Conclusion}
The first goal of this lab was to learn how to use a linear potentiometer to measure displacement.  
We successfully built a physical circuit containing the potentiometer and integrated it into the LabVIEW software, as well as calibrated it within 1\% FS.  
The next goal was to determine the twist angle from displacement measurements.  The potentiometer was used at various points along the chord with a weight at one end to measure deflection due to the weight at one end.  
Using geometric relations, the angle of twist was determined and the shear center location was calculated.  The final goal was to obtain the flexural and torsional stiffness of the wing section.  With several more potentiometer measurements along the span of the wing, these values were calculated 
using equations provided in the lab manual.
