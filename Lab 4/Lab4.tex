\section{Introduction}
In this experiment we (1) Learn how to measure pressure with different sensors, (2) Construct a Wheatstone quarter-bridge circuit, and (3) Develop an understanding for strain gauge measurements. 

In this two-part experiment we gather input voltage readings for the pressure of two vessels containing liquid using two different methods. The first method involves calibrated pressure transducers and a full strain gauge bridge with a direct application of internal pressure to the vessel. The second method involves constructing a quarter-bridge circuit to read strain measurements on a soda can as pressure is released. These demonstrations set a foundation for understanding the precision and sensitivity of these sensors used to measure pressure. 

\section{Equipment}
Devices and hardware used in this lab include:
\begin{itemize}

\item Digital Calipers: 
\vspace{1mm}

Used for measuring outer and inner dimensions of objects. In our case we use it to the measure the wall thickness of the soda can in $mm$.
\vspace{2.5mm}

\item PX309 SERIES Pressure Transducer/Transmitter:
\vspace{1mm}

Calibrated pressure transducer used to measure and convert pressure to an analog electrical signal or an output voltage. For this lab, the transducer is connected to a cylindrical poly-carbonate vessel containing liquid and is used alongside a full strain gauge bridge.
\vspace{2.5mm}

\item Strain Gauge: 
\vspace{1mm}

Sensor used to measure surface strains which then converts it into a change in electrical resistance. An output voltage is produced when a surface strain occurs since there is a resistance change within the bridge configuration. 
\vspace{2.5mm}

\item Cylindrical Poly-carbonate Vessel: 
\vspace{1mm}

A vessel containing a liquid equipped with a pressure transducer, full strain gauge bridge, a pressure regulator, and valves for the intake and release of pressure. We conduct Part 1 of gathering measurements with this vessel.
\vspace{2.5mm}

\item Aluminum Soda Can:
\vspace{1mm}

A full diet coke can strapped with a strain gauge sensor for Part 2 of measurements in this lab. The can is then opened to release the internal pressure for which we gather our strain measurement.
\vspace{2.5mm}

\item Sand Paper: 
\vspace{1mm}

Used to smooth the surface of the Aluminum soda can. The strain gauge sensor can then be securely adhered to the surface of the soda can.

\item Pressure Regulator/Dial: 
\vspace{1mm}

A dial used to adjust the internal pressure of the Poly-carbonate vessel.
\vspace{2.5mm}

\item DAQ, NI-9215 Voltage Input Module, and LabVIEW:
\vspace{1mm}

Data Acquisition System used to process sample measurements into digital data. NI-9215 is an analog input module used to measure the output voltage signals of sensors and send it through the DAQ system. LabVIEW used to model these output voltages read from the DAQ of the transducer and strain gauge measurements.
\vspace{2.5mm}

\item Solderless Breadboard and Jumper Wires: 
\vspace{1mm}

Used to make connections to the input analog modules and to construct circuits. In Part 2 of this lab we build the Wheatstone quarter-bridge circuit as shown below:

\section{Procedure}
The procedure for this experiment can be broken up into two parts:
\subsection{Part 1: Poly-carbonate Vessel}

\subsection{Part 2: Aluminum Soda Can}

\section{Data Processing}

For part 1, our first values will be in voltages. We will convert these to pressures using the following equation:
\[
P = \frac{V}{0.004} - 14.7
\]

What are any of the sources of error or discrepancies in the data? How can we account for these?
- The gauge on the pressure vessel may not be accurate
- The true measurements were likely taken with an inaccurate gauge, and our uncertainties are likely larger than we think
- Over time, the pressure vessel leaked
- The pressure vessel could be at a different temperature than the room temperature
- The DAQ could be interpreting the data incorrectly from an error in the voltage.
- Delay in pressure changes from the valve opening.
